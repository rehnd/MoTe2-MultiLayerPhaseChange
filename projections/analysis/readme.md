# Analysis of mode calculations

The results of calculations in `../calculations` are used here to find
the projection of modes with different numbers of vacancies (1,2,3)
onto the modes in the 0 vacancy case. Each folder contains python
routines for the analysis.

The `pics` folder contains the main results.
